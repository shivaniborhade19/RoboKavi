# *pnoise*

*pnoise* is a pure-Python, Numpy-based, vectorized port of Processing's `noise()` function. The `p` in *pnoise* stands for Processing, Perlin, Python, "port", and probably other things I haven't though of yet.

## Why?

I wrote this port before switching to [vnoise](https://github.com/plottertools/vnoise) and, although I'm no longer using it, I figured I would keep it around. 

## How does it compare to *vnoise*?

| | *pnoise* | *vnoise* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Algorithm | "classic Perlin noise of 1983" | "Perlin improved noise" |
| License | LGPL v2.1 | MIT |
| Scalar API | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vectorized API | ✅ | ✅ |
| 3D function | ✅ | ✅ |
| 2D function | ❌ (can be derived from 3D but slower) | ✅ |
| 1D function | ❌ (can be derived from 3D but slower) | ✅ |
